There must be prompts on the screen that says: a. Hello, how are you today? (You must reply to this question) b. Shall we begin? (You must reply to this question) c. What's the first number? d. What's the second number?
The terminal will output the right answer saying whether the numbers are equal or which is larger.
There must be a final message Wow!!! We make an awesome team!!! High five dude!!!
